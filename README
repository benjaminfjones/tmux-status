tmux status bar scripts
=======================

To use:

 1) Create a configuration based on `config` in the repo.  Tweak the
    variables as desired to produce the right mix of status bar
    attributes.  Variables are:

    * `PREFIX` - this comes at the beginning of the status bar.

    * `SUFFIX` - this comes at the end of the status bar.

    * `DEFAULT_ITEM_ATTR` - the attribute string inserted just prior
      to each status bar entry.

    * `SEPARATOR` - the string inserted in between status bar entries.

    * `SCRIPTS` - space-separated list of script names, without ".sh"
      extensions, referring to scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

 2) Update your `tmux.conf` to set `status-right` as follows:

    set -g status-right '#(.../tmux-status/tmux-status.sh .../config)'

Notes:

If a script named in $SCRIPTS does not exist, it will be quietly
omitted from the status bar.  If a script in $SCRIPTS does exist but
is not executable, it will be quietly omitted from the status bar.  If
a script in $SCRIPTS exists and is executable but produces no output,
it will be quietly omitted from the status bar.

Otherwise, the output of the script will be added to the status bar
and separators will be added as appropriate.

The main script, `tmux-status.sh`, can be run with the `--strict`
argument to force the script to exit if it cannot find all and run of
the named scripts in $SCRIPTS:

  tmux-config.sh ../config --strict

$PREFIX and $SUFFIX will only be added to the status bar if at least
one status bar entry ran successfully.
